<div class="policy_main">
    <p>Aegis 24/7 is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.
        We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information.
        A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner at www.aoic.gov.au
        In this Privacy Policy, 'us' 'we' or 'our' means Aegis 24/7 and ‘app’ means all mobile applications we develop, operate and manage. We are committed to respecting your privacy. Our Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information.
        By providing personal information to us, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any other arrangements that apply between us. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time by publishing changes to it on our website. We encourage you to check our website periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current Privacy Policy.
        Personal information includes information or an opinion about an individual that is reasonably identifiable. For example, this may include your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details. </p>
    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p> We collect information to provide better services to you and all our users – from the basics like which language you speak, to more complex things like what content of ours matters most to you. We collect information in the following ways:</p>
    <p>1. Information you give us. <br />
        We collect information about you as you register for an account with us, create or modify your profile, use, access, or interact with our services or our websites. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account with us. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address or cell phone number.
    <p>2. Information we get from your use of our services. <br />
        We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our services or you view and interact with our content. This information includes:</p>
    <ul class="ui_abc_2">
        <li>Device information. We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your account.</li>
        <li>Log information. When you use our services or view content provided by us, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="ui_abc ms-4 ps-5">
        <li>details of how you used our service
        <li>telephony log information like your phone number
        <li>Internet Protocol address;
        <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL; and
        <li>Cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
        <li>Location information. When you use a location-enabled Aegis 24/7 service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
        <li>Unique application numbers. Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</li>
        <li>Local storage. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. How we use information we collect</h2>
    <p>We may use the information we collect, including your personal information and transaction information, from all of our services in any one or more of the locations that Aegis 24/7 has operations or otherwise conducts business (these locations currently being Australia, the United States and the India) for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul class="ul_custom_1 ps-0 ms-3">

        <li>as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Information we share</h2>
    <p> We do not share personal information with third parties unless one of the following circumstances apply:</p>
    <ul class="number_txt">
        <li> <span class="fw-bold d-block">With your consent </span> We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Aegis 24/7 when we have your consent to do so.</li>
        <li> <span class="fw-bold d-block"> With account administrators</span> If your account is managed for you by an organization administrator then your organization’s administrator and/or resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your information (including your email and other data).

            <li> view statistics regarding your account;</li>

        <li> <span class="fw-bold d-block"> To address fraud, security or technical issues </span> We will share your personal information with trusted third parties where necessary to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
            For legal reasons
            We may disclose your information if required by applicable law, regulation or as part of any actual or prospective legal process (including if reasonably necessary to enforce applicable Terms of Service or in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights). If we receive a request from a regulatory body or law enforcement agency, and if permitted under the CCPA and other laws, we may disclose certain information to such bodies or agencies. </li>
        <li> <span class="fw-bold d-block"> Merger or acquisition</span> If we merge with or are acquired by another business, we may share your personal information with the new owners of the business and their advisors. We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
        <li><span class="fw-bold d-block"> Aggregated, non-identifiable information </span> We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites.

This could also include government bodies, industry groups, insurers and educational/training facilities.
            We will not sell your information or data to marketers, advertisers or third parties. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Sensitive data</h2>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive data on our application. ‘Sensitive information’ includes an individual’s health information, their membership of a trade union or political association, their sexual orientation or practices, and more.</p>
    <h2>5. Retention of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We will retain your personal information for the time necessary to provide the services we perform for you, or to achieve other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you can always request that we stop processing or delete your personal information.</p>
    <p>We’re required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law. When we no longer require your information, we’ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.</p>
    <p>We may need to retain certain personal information after we cease providing you with products or services to enforce our terms, for fraud prevention, to identify, issue or resolve legal claims and/or for proper record keeping. </p>
    <h2>6. Data ownership</h2>
    <p>You own the data and other materials and information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our services. We call this ‘Your Data’.</p>
    <p> We may generate aggregated data sets, reports and analysis relating to your use of our services. We ensure that this data is anonymized and does not identify you. We own the data in these aggregated data sets, reports and analysis and may use this data for internal purposes only for the purposes of improving the product and services we make available to you.</p>
    <h2>7. Controls and choices regarding your information and data</h2>
    <p>You can exercise certain controls and choices regarding your data. You can exercise these options in writing by contacting <a href="#" class="custom_item">privacy@aegis-247.com.</a></p>

    </ul>
    <p>Please be aware that we may not be able to provide certain services or support to you, if you choose to exercise certain controls.</p>
    <h2>8. Your information for direct marketing</h2>
    <p>We and/or our carefully selected business partners may send you direct marketing communications and information about our service and products. This may take the form of emails, SMS, mail or other forms of communication, in accordance with the Spam Act and the Privacy Act. You may opt-out of receiving marketing materials from us by contacting us using the details set out below or by using the opt-out facilities provided (e.g. an unsubscribe link). </p>
    <h2>9. Security of your information</h2>
    Your personal information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
    When your personal information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information. However, most of the personal information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a minimum of seven years.
    We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:
    We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
    We may hold your personal information in either electronic or hard copy form. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
    We have multiple authentication and access control measures to ensure data is only accessed by authorized personnel.
    Our Agreements with our employees, contractors and third party service providers also contain appropriate provisions with regard to the confidentiality and protection of your data; and
    We undertake security assessments of third parties with whom we share your data to ensure we have confidence in their systems and procedures.
    We enforce strong encryption of all data at rest.
    We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorized access, modification or disclosure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information. For example, we store account and product usage information in encrypted cloud-based systems and databases. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. 
    The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our servers via third party networks; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
    <h2>10. Disclosure of personal information outside Australia</h2>
    <p>We may disclose personal information outside of Australia to third party service providers who assist us in providing the services to you who are based in India, as well as cloud services provider Amazon Web Services, Inc (AWS) located in the United States of America. Aegis 24/7 processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. When you provide your personal information to us, you consent to the disclosure of your information outside of Australia and acknowledge that we are not required to ensure that overseas recipients handle that personal information in compliance with Australian Privacy Law. We will, however, take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient will deal with such personal information in a way that is consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

        We will not charge any fee for your access request, but may charge an administrative fee for providing a copy of your personal information. <br />
